	<p>Valuing confidence over efficiency, Schongte used to be a python one trick. He would make discord bot, website, game and even tall order like competetive programming with his beloved language.</p>
	<br>
	<p>However, as time goes by, Schongte found himself in the hellhole known as 'timeout', even when coding everything in manners that was deemed 'most effecient' by Python 3.7.x standard.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Then gradual change began to appear, he would learn to do things in other languages such as JavaScript, where he would use it to make discord bot, webhooks even manipulate excel. Utilise c++ making arduino gadgets. And use c# to make mods for game known as 'terraria'.</p>
